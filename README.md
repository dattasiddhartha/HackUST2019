This is an augmented reality system/game where people can see highlights (bounding boxes) over their food, and tapping their food will produce a certain instrumental sound to synthesize music (including guitar chords, piano on different scales, and drums); it executed on Mixed Reality lens with object detection.

Model weights used can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1tWczVaRlEEcPgvOBpk5LWGwZWvnaFuMk?usp=sharing) and shouuld be paced in the *CVMusicSynthesis* directory; else the complete repository can also be downloaded from [here](https://bit.ly/2P7YYRQ). Download the repository and run the *objectdetection+airdrums-ver2.ipynb* notebook to run the model.
